Alex, programming hater and videogames fan

- Iâ€™m currently learning Python,Java,HTML,CSS (and I suck at those 4)
- IDK where to collaborate, I have no idea what I want in my life
- Ask me about emulation, my favorite hobbie
- I Have been studying these shit for 5 semesters and still dont know a shit about it
- Fun fact: I love Slasher movies, Friday the 13th the goat



- Seriously man, You Don't want me at your office if you require a programmer, you wanna call Kleber or Jordy for that, they are the goat at these shit
